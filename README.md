# Lab137_Team8_DSAI_Final_Code
# Overview
Our project aims to improve breast cancer prediction on whether the diagnosis is malignant or benign. We performed exploratory data analysis to help us better visualise the data and clean it for the training of our models. We also used 4 different machine models and a few model metrics to pick our choice of model.

# File Description

1. "Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb" contains out EDA for our Dataset.
2. "Machine_Learning_Models.ipynb" contains our training of our Machine Learning Models
3. "cancer.csv" is the CSV file of our dataset.

# Dataset


# Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data visualisation
3. Heatmap and correlation

# Machine Learning Models
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Logistic Regression
4. Support Vector Machine

We used 4 model metrics to pick our final model. Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 Score. The Accuracy and Recall metrics are the more important ones as it tells us the percentage of data that are classified accurately and the percentage of true positives (cancer being detected as malignant correctly).
